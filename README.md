## The challenge
Build a Rock Paper Scissors game as part of a hiring process which included two interviews, pre and post implementing the game. The rules are: <br />
```
Rock vs Paper -> Paper wins
Rock vs Scissors -> Rock wins
Paper vs Scissors -> Scissors wins
```
It was totally up me how I wanted to work, what programming language I wanted to use, if I wanted to deliver game logic only or build a web based interface where a player is challenged by the computer or where two players can play against each other. 

In my game the user can play against the computer that randomly chooses a weapon, the player or the computer get a point for each win.
